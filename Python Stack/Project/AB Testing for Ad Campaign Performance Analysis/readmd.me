A/B Testing for Ad Performance Optimization

    Conducted A/B testing on Facebook ad campaigns to analyze CTR and conversions.
    Used T-tests & Chi-square tests to compare ad spend, age, gender, and interests.
    Found higher spend improves CTR, but not conversions; age significantly affects CTR.
    Created data visualizations (boxplots, subplots) to compare performance across groups.
    Provided business recommendations for improving ad targeting & lead quality.
